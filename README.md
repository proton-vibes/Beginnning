# Description
The file 'Script for the PLQY mapping' contains a code to evaluate the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of an emitting nanomaterial. Rest are the supporting files needed to successfully execute the code. 

An example calculation is provided with the data that was collected on 10 nm CsPbBr3 perovskites. The material was excited with a 405 nm laser.
